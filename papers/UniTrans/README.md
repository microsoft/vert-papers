## 🎥 Overview

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-lingual NER termed UniTrans, which uniﬁes both model transfer and data transfer based on their complementarity, and leverages beneﬁcial information from unlabeled target-language data via knowledge distillation.
We also propose a voting scheme to generate pseudo hard labels for part of words in the unlabeled target-language data, so as to enhance knowledge distillation with supervision from both hard and soft labels. We evaluate the proposed UniTrans on benchmark datasets for four target languages.
Experimental results show that UniTrans achieves new state-of-the-art performance for all target languages.
We also extend UniTrans with teacher ensembling, which leads to further performance gains.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Requirements

- python 3.7
- pytorch 1.0.0
- [HuggingFace PyTorch Pretrained mBERT](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers.git) (2019.10.27)
- [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE.git) for translation: (2019.12.17)

Other pip package show in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The code may work on other python and pytorch version. However, we ran experiments in the above environment.

### Train and Evaluate

For _Linux_ severs,

```bash
# Generation tgt translated datasets from src dataset
bash scripts/run_translate.sh

# Fine-tune mBERT in src dataset
bash scripts/run_src.sh

# Train & Evaluate in tgt dataset
bash scripts/run_tgt.sh
```

For _Windows_ severs,

```cmd
<!--  Generation tgt translated datasets from src dataset  -->
call scripts\run_translate.bat

<!--  Fine-tune mBERT in src dataset  -->
call scripts\run_src.bat

<!--  Train & Evaluate in tgt dataset  -->
call scripts\run_tgt.bat
```

before generation the translation dataset, you need have the embeddings file and dictionaries follow with that steps.

1. Translate source-language labeled data.
2. Download [monolingual word embeddings](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html) `wiki.language.vec` to `data/embedding`.
3. Download [src-tgt test dictionaries](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) for evaluation (English to other languages) to `data/dict`.

## 🍯 Datasets

We use the following widely-used benchmark datasets for experiments:

- CoNLL-2002 [Tjong Kim Sang, 2002](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W02-2024/) for Spanish [es] and Dutch [nl] NER;
- CoNLL-2003 [Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419/) for English [en] and German [de] NER;
- NoDaLiDa-2019 [Johansen, 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-6123/) for Norwegian [no] NER.

All datasets are annotated with 4 entity types: LOC, MISC, ORG, and PER. Each dataset is split into training, dev, and test sets.

## 📋 Results

We reports the zero-resource cross-lingual NER results of the proposed UniTrans on the 4 target languages, alongside those reported by prior state-of-the-art methods and those of two re-implemented baseline methods, i.e., Model Transfer and Data Transfer.
